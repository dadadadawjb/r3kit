# VIVE Tracker 3 Device
First instal `Steam` and `SteamVR`.
Then modify `SteamVR`'s two configs, as `"enable": false` to `"enable": true` in `<Steam Directory>/steamapps/common/SteamVR/drivers/null/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`, and `"requireHmd": true` to `"requireHmd": false`, `"forcedDriver": ""` to `"forcedDriver": "null"` and `"activateMultipleDrivers": false` to `"activateMultipleDrivers": true` in `<Steam Directory>/steamapps/common/SteamVR/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`, to support for headless.
To change the action rule, `Manage trackers` in `SteamVR`.
